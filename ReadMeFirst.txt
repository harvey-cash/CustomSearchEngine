		Harvey's Custom Search Engine
		~~~~~~~~ Version 1.0 ~~~~~~~~

A clear, self explanatorily named abstract search engine - complete
with A-Star Search (and also Breadth-First, though you won't want to
use that) and simple commenting to help you implement searches for
your own problems*.

					- Harvey Cash, 2017


* "problems" are limited to those solvable mathematically through
search, and therefore likely does not extend to issues troubling
you at home.


		~~~~~~~~ How To Use ~~~~~~~~

Following the comments within Search.java and SearchState.java,
you'll need to describe your problem / puzzle through the
following three classes:

[YOUR_NAME_HERE]Search.java	-->	(extends Search)
[YOUR_NAME_HERE]State.java	-->	(extends SearchState)
Run[YOUR_NAME_HERE]Search.java	-->	(starts the whole thing)

(this naming scheme is merely suggested, you can call them
whatever you like)

TestSearch, TestState, and RunTestSearch are included as
helpful examples!
